Here are descriptions `README.md` file for each of the three tasks:

### Task 3: Information Gathering using Maltego

**Description:**
In Task 3, we will utilize Maltego, a powerful open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool, to perform information gathering. Maltego helps us discover and visualize connections and relationships between different pieces of data. You will learn how to use Maltego to gather information about specific targets or organizations by querying various data sources, such as social media profiles, domain information, and more. The collected data can be invaluable for security assessments, threat intelligence, or any scenario that requires comprehensive information on a target.

### Task 4: Sniffing Attack using Wireshark

**Description:**
Task 4 involves conducting a sniffing attack using Wireshark, a popular network packet analyzer. In this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in intercepting and analyzing network traffic. Wireshark allows you to capture and dissect network packets, which can be useful for diagnosing network issues, but it can also be used maliciously for eavesdropping. You will learn how to set up Wireshark, capture network traffic, and analyze the data to gain insights into the information exchanged on a network. This task aims to raise awareness about network security and the importance of encryption.

### Task 5: Network Scanning using Nmap

**Description:**
Task 5 focuses on network scanning using Nmap, a versatile open-source tool for network discovery and vulnerability assessment. Nmap enables you to identify hosts, open ports, and services running on a network, making it an essential tool for network administrators and security professionals. In this task, you will learn how to use Nmap to scan a target network, gather information about its structure, and identify potential vulnerabilities. Network scanning is an essential part of network security, and understanding how to use Nmap effectively is valuable for both defensive and offensive security practices.
